        "Each injury is different, and each person's health history is unique.

Depending on severity of the disorder, a patient can expect to be seen 1-3 visits a week in the clinic to regain their function while simultaneously doing a personalized home exercise plan. For example, typical sprain and strains may take 4-6 weeks while post-surgical procedures may take 2-3 months to rehab, your physiotherapy will work with your individual schedule to accommodate a plan that will facilitate healing and independence.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is My Progress Measured?",

Additionally, you will fill out a subjective questionnaire regarding your current function with activities of daily living. During subsequent visits, our doctor  will monitor and assess your progress with activities during treatment sessions and provide regular feedback to you. Midway through your plan of care, the physiotherapy will often re-evaluate your function, update your Physiotherapy  goals, and provide a progress note to your referring physician. At the end of care, your physiotherapy will re-assess your function, check your progress with your activities of daily living, and provide a note to your referring physician with your updated functional status.",
